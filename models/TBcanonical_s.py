    """Constructor for the tightbinding model

    This class constructs the model, and stores model-related data.
    It also offers methods to build the radial functions and pairpotentials.

    MatrixElements always needs to have the named methods helements,
    slements (for overlap), and pairpotentials (for forces and energy).
    The TBH assumes the model to have a MatrixElements class with these
    methods.

    This model supports:
        NO tabularisation
        NO pairpotentials
        NO overlap

    Attributes:
        atomic: atomic model data, such as species, on-site energy, orbitals, etc
        data: imported json hamiltonian dictionary
        function_grid: list of all interatomic hamiltonian functions

    Methods:
        helements: compute hopping integral for supplied atomic species
