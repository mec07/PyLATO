class MatrixElements:
	"""Constructor for the tightbinding model

	This class constructs the model, and stores model-related data.
	It also offers methods to build the radial functions and pairpotentials.

	MatrixElements always needs to have the named methods helements,
	slements (for overlap), and pairpotentials (for forces and energy).
	The Hamiltonian assumes the model to have a MatrixElements class with these
	methods.

	This model supports:
		NO tabularisation
		NO pairpotentials
		NO overlap

	Attributes:
		atomic: atomic model data, such as species, on-site energy, orbitals, etc
		data: imported json hamiltonian dictionary
		function_grid: list of all interatomic hamiltonian functions

	Methods:
		helements: compute hopping integral for supplied atomic species
